Rosewood Migrations
===================

When I was a kid, my dad raced a vintage Jaguar. We would go to vintage British car meetups and I'd check out the beautiful old Bentleys and Rolls Royces. In the economic boom of the late 80s, my dad began brokering vintage cars, mostly selling them from sellers in America and Europe to buyers in Japan. I got to see and sit in a lot of beautiful old Jags, Bentleys, and Rollses, all of which had lovely interiors with wood, leather, and brass - and many of which had dining trays in the backseats, like on an airplane.

I don't know why we in the Rails community have ignored the wonderful luxury of tab completion for such a long time when it comes to our migrations, but I for one am simply too experienced to tolerate the pitiful limping Yugo of 20111234980701987234098712_filename.rb when I could help myself to the graceful, sophisticated comfort of filename_20118175098237401981982734098172304987109872341, which is more amenable to tab-completion and thus easier to use.

Likewise, I use bash, and it's very, very rare that I have to type a filename at all, because when I'm not tab-completing my way through the entire filename based on only a few characters, I'm using special variables like !$ and !!. Consequently, actually clicking and dragging to copy a migration filename feels like reading by candlelight in the age of electricity. There's simply no call for such primitive nonsense on an operating system like OS X, which makes it trivial to deposit filenames into your copy/paste buffer automatically.

Good day, sir.
